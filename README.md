# BetaBank

Beta Bank customers are leaving: little by little, chipping away every month. The bankers figured out it’s cheaper to save the existing customers rather than to attract new ones. You have the data on clients’ past behavior and termination of contracts with the bank. Therefore, you must build a predictive model that can indicate whether or not a customer will leave the bank soon.

* Find & Eliminate errors in the data
## Step 3 | Analyze the data
* Conduct EDA & SDA while exercising the 5 analytic frameworks (if applicable):
  * What happened? - Descriptive 
  * Why did it happen? - Diagnostic 
  * What will happen? - Predictive
  * How can we make it happen? - Prescriptive
## Step 4 | Build a predictive model 
* Consider and select data that is useful to analyze the information on the customers' behavior that can pinpoint a churning or non-churning customer.
